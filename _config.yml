  I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Engineering And Sciences at Florida Institute of Technology, under the supervision of <a href="https://cs.fit.edu/~pkc/"> Dr. Philip Chan </a> . 
  My research interests are in the areas of representation learning, anomaly detection and open set recognition.
  Prior to this, I obtained my Master of Science Degree in Informatics (Machine Learning) in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, UK in 2014, under the supervision of <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jeh/">Professor Jane Hillston</a>.
  I gained my Bachelor of Engineering in the School of Software Engineering in the Xiamen University, China in 2013.
