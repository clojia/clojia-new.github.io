  I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Engineering And Sciences at Florida Institute of Technology, under the supervision of [Dr. Philip Chan](https://cs.fit.edu/~pkc/). 
  My research interests are in the areas of representation learning, anomaly detection and open set recognition.
  Prior to this, I obtained my Master of Science Degree in Informatics (Machine Learning) in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, UK in 2014, under the supervision of [Professor Jane Hillston](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jeh/).
  I gained my Bachelor of Engineering in the School of Software Engineering in the Xiamen University, China in 2013. 
  I have also spent time in the data team at Factual Inc. (merged with Foursquare), and in the business intelligence at Trip.com Group.
